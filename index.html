    <h2>Ronald K. Rono</h2>
    <p class="AboutMe">My name is Ronald Rono currently a student at Moringa School pursuing Software Development.
        I've worked as a <br> School tutor in my local church and I decided to pursue programming 
        because I want to solve the current technology issues<br> and develop new skills to improve on 
        programming languages because technology is the future.
