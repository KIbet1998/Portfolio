    <p class="Description">My name is Ronald Rono currently a student at Moringa School pursuing 
        <strong>Software Development</strong>.<br> I did my primary School education in a small town called <em>Kericho</em>
         and later moved to Nairobi.I haven't worked<br> professionally but i've had a chance of 
         becoming a Church tutor in my local church.I decided to pursue programming because<br>
         it's one of the major factors in the field of technology and I believe that technology is the future.
         <br>My current skill is basically coding,I'm getting to understand  coding a lot more.My hobbies 
         are travelling,listening to songs and connecting to new people.
